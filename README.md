# Project Info

## Deployment

Currently we just use runserver. Look at [this](https://github.com/itsnamgyu/django-two) for a full Ubuntu AWS setup walkthrough.

## Project Structure

~~Will employ [this structure](https://www.revsys.com/blog/2014/nov/21/recommended-django-project-layout/)...~~~

Too [complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NPBIwQyPWE) and doesn't really tell you how to divide the project into apps.

Lets try to just make apps based on the grouping of *models*

Thanks to [J. C. Leit√£o@StackOverlflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18270898/django-best-practice-for-splitting-up-project-into-apps)

## Coding Convensions

Follow the pep8 coding guide (no-brainer for Python). Try to check your code with flake8 before committing. It's included in requirements.txt! Just do

```
flake8 ho.py
```

# Behind Story

Used to be a team project for Naver D2 Fest 2018, but didn't work out :(

Decided to make this my mildly-cool website project for [learning Django](https://github.com/itsnamgyu/django-two/projects/1?)

It's actually quite cool _IMO_
