# Project Structure

Will employ [this structure](https://www.revsys.com/blog/2014/nov/21/recommended-django-project-layout/)...


# Deployment

Currently we just use runserver. Look at [this](https://github.com/itsnamgyu/django-two) for a full Ubuntu AWS setup walkthrough.


# Behind Story

Used to be a team project for Naver D2 Fest 2018, but didn't work out :(

Decided to make this my mildly-cool website project for [learning Django](https://github.com/itsnamgyu/django-two/projects/1?)

It's actually quite cool _IMO_
